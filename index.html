      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A driven and commercially astute IT professional with a diverse technical and operational skill set. Having in-depth knowledge across a wide range of technologies, with the ability to deliver efficient and highly productive solutions in high pressure environments.</p>
      <p>Friendly and personable, I work methodically and on my own initiative. I am good at building and maintaining relationships with a wide range of people and really enjoy working collaboratively; This has enabled me to deliver quality work to short deadlines. Excellent communication skills allow me to interact effectively with colleagues at all levels of an organisation.</p>
      <p>Hardworking, organised, reliable and with the ability to pick up new skills quickly, I am constantly seeking to learn and continuously build upon the knowledge I have already obtained and with a desire to deliver quality solutions. Iâ€™ve worked in fast paced, high pressure environments and have strong logical analytical skills that allow me to troubleshoot and work through problems effectively.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>

      <p>Steam Engines and Computer Science.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A Job where I can progress on what I have already achieved and further myself in my goal to becoming a well established full stack developer. I love to work in environments where I will be challanged with taxing projects, problems and change requests.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Worcester, UK.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The IT market space changed dramatically over the last 10 years and continues to do so. Infrastructure roles in SME's are becoming less of a requirement as more and more businesses move to cloud based hosting solutions provided by the likes of Microsoft Azure, AWS and GC.</p> 
      <p>With this in mind, I strongly believe and see that web based applications are where the market demand has grown and is further gaining strength as businesses turn to SaaS (Software As A Service) models on these hosting platforms.</p>
      <p>During my career I have worked along side many Developers while I have worked in other areas of IT. I have always found what developers do of great interest, but I never pursued it as a career due to not being sure if it would be something I would enjoy fulltime.</p>
      <p>I have since spent time self-pace studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C++ to see if I would enjoy it before committing to it as a career move. It turns out not only do I enjoy it, I have also been able to pick it up quickly!</p>
      <p>Deciding to enroll on this Coding Bootcamp is where I hope to speed up my coding skills and abilities, and I'm excited to be able to learn coding in more detail.</p>
